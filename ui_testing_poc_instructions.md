# ui_testing_poc — Instructions for Claude Code

---

## CRITICAL: First Steps After Reading

After reading these instructions, you MUST:

1. **Report plugin visibility:** "I can see cc_win_plugin with tools: [list them]" OR "I cannot see cc_win_plugin"
2. **Confirm understanding:** State that you understand the build process uses `dotnet publish -r win-x64`
3. **Confirm error handling:** State that you will stop and report any errors immediately

Example acknowledgment:
> "I've read the ui_testing_poc instructions. I can see cc_win_plugin with tools: list_files, run_process, read_file, close_window. I understand I need to use `dotnet publish -r win-x64` to build a standalone exe. I will stop and report any errors immediately. Ready to proceed."

If you CANNOT see the plugin, say so immediately.

---

## Purpose

This project tests the cc_win_plugin. You will build a simple WPF application, run it, monitor its behavior through log files, and close it gracefully.

---

## cc_win_plugin Guidelines

You have access to the cc_win_plugin which provides native Windows tools. Use these instead of shell commands for file and process operations.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| `list_files` | List directory contents | You need to see what files exist in a folder |
| `run_process` | Launch an application | You need to start a UI app or background process |
| `read_file` | Read file contents | You need to check logs, config files, or any text file |
| `close_window` | Gracefully close a window | You need to shut down an application |

### When to Use Plugin vs Direct Commands

**Use direct commands for:**
- Building and compiling (`dotnet publish -r win-x64`)
- File copy/move operations (`copy`)
- Any operation where you need to see output and wait for completion

Run these commands directly — do NOT use bash, cmd, powershell, or any shell. Just run `dotnet` or `copy` as commands.

**Use plugin tools for:**
- Listing directory contents
- Launching applications
- Reading files (especially while another app is running)
- Closing applications

### Important Behavior

- `run_process` starts the application and returns immediately — it does not wait for the app to exit
- `close_window` sends a graceful close message to the window
- All file paths are relative to project root
- Plugin operations are sandboxed to the project directory

### CRITICAL: Error Handling

**Every command and tool call MUST be checked for errors.**

For direct commands:
- Exit code 0 = success, non-zero = failure
- If failure → STOP and report the full error

For plugin tools:
- Check response for "error" field
- If error exists → STOP and report
- For run_process: verify PID is a positive integer

**Never ignore errors. Never proceed after a failure.**

## Application Specification

### Main Window

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Width | 400 pixels |
| Height | 200 pixels |
| Title | "UI Testing POC" |
| ResizeMode | NoResize |
| WindowStartupLocation | CenterScreen |

### UI Elements

The window contains a single button:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Content | "Click Me" |
| Width | 120 pixels |
| Height | 40 pixels |
| Position | Centered (HorizontalAlignment="Center", VerticalAlignment="Center") |

### Behavior

When the button is clicked, the app writes a log entry. That's all it does.

---

## Logging Specification

### AppLogger Class

Create a static class `AppLogger` with:

- **Log file path:** `logs/app.log` relative to the executable's directory
- **Directory creation:** Create `logs/` folder if it doesn't exist
- **Log format:** `[yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff] [INFO] {message}`
- **Write mode:** Append to file

### Events to Log

| When | Log Message |
|------|-------------|
| Application starts (in App.xaml.cs OnStartup or MainWindow constructor) | `App started` |
| Button is clicked | `Button clicked` |

### Expected Log File Content

After starting the app:
```
[2025-12-16 14:30:00.123] [INFO] App started
```

After clicking the button once:
```
[2025-12-16 14:30:00.123] [INFO] App started
[2025-12-16 14:30:05.456] [INFO] Button clicked
```

## Task: Build, Run, and Test

### Phase 1: Build

1. Create all source files listed in the project structure
2. Run `dotnet publish src/UiTestingPoc.csproj -r win-x64`
3. Copy the exe to project root: `copy out\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows\win-x64\publish\UiTestingPoc.exe .`
4. Verify the exe exists

**Phase 1 Verification Checklist:**
```
- [ ] All source files created (App.xaml, App.xaml.cs, MainWindow.xaml, MainWindow.xaml.cs, AppLogger.cs, UiTestingPoc.csproj)
- [ ] dotnet publish completed with exit code 0
- [ ] out\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows\win-x64\publish\ directory exists
- [ ] UiTestingPoc.exe exists in publish folder
- [ ] copy command succeeded
- [ ] UiTestingPoc.exe exists in project root
```

Report checklist results before proceeding to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Launch and Verify Startup

1. Use `run_process` to launch `UiTestingPoc.exe`
2. Check the response for errors
3. Verify PID is a positive integer
4. Check that `logs/app.log` exists using `list_files`
5. Read the log file using `read_file` and verify it contains "App started"
6. Report: "App is running. Log shows startup. Waiting for you to click the button."

**Phase 2 Verification Checklist:**
```
- [ ] run_process returned successfully (no "error" field)
- [ ] PID is a positive integer: ____
- [ ] logs/ directory exists
- [ ] logs/app.log file exists
- [ ] Log contains "App started"
```

**If run_process returns an error:**
- STOP immediately
- Report the full error message
- Check if the exe file exists
- Check if the exe path is correct
- Do NOT proceed to Phase 3

### Phase 3: Wait for Button Click

1. Tell me the app is running and waiting
2. Poll the log file using `read_file` periodically
3. Look for "Button clicked" in the log content
4. When you see it, proceed to Phase 4

### Phase 4: Close and Report

1. Close the application gracefully using `close_window` with the PID
2. Read the final log file content
3. Report what happened:
   - Did the app start successfully?
   - Did you detect the button click?
   - Did the app close gracefully?
   - Show the final log file contents

**Phase 4 Verification Checklist:**
```
- [ ] close_window called with correct PID
- [ ] close_window returned successfully
- [ ] Final log read successfully
- [ ] Report includes: startup status, click detection, close status, log contents
```

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] App window appears on screen
- [ ] Log file is created with startup message
- [ ] You detect when I click the button (by reading the log)
- [ ] App closes without crashing
- [ ] You report the full sequence of events
